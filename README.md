# React useState Practice: Controlled Components

A modern, responsive React application demonstrating professional state management and UI implementation.

## 🔗 Live Demo
Check out the live application here: **[react-usestate-practice.vercel.app](https://react-usestate-practice.vercel.app/)**

## 🚀 Technical Overview
This project focuses on the fundamental concepts of React's **Functional Components** and **Hooks**. It features a clean, dark-themed user interface with a "Glassmorphism" aesthetic.

### Core Features
- **Controlled Inputs:** Real-time state synchronization for user name inputs using the `onChange` event handler.
- **Counter Logic:** Implementation of increment/decrement functions using the `useState` hook.
- **Responsive Layout:** Mobile-first design approach using CSS Flexbox and Viewport units (`vh`, `vw`).
- **Modern UI:** Styled with high-contrast linear gradients and smooth transitions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js (Vite)
- **Deployment:** Vercel (CI/CD)
- **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`)
- **Styling:** Modern CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Glassmorphism)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
